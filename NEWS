Release 20140527
================

Changes:

- Priority of '&&' and '||' is set lower than '==' (and other
  compare operators) so
    a==x && b==y
  would be the same as
    (a==x) && (b==y)

Fixed bugs:

- Pair-type mapping returns wrong values.

- Calling a function without a final return may fail or
  terminate the caller.

Release 20140505
================

Fixed bugs:

- Clear error information on parser start. Now it's possible
  to call csp_parse() again after a fail.

- Fixed parser 'Undefined variable' error occuring because of
  internal buffer containing variable identifier was overwritten
  if input buffer was filled in small chunks.
